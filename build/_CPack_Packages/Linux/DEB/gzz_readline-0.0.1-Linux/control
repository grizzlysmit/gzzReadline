Description: Extension to Gnu Readline to get a prompt with a default value
 Desciption
 ==========
 .
 This is a prompt package based on gnu readline.
 The only difference is that it supports prefilling the edit buffer with text to edit, so it is easier to fix your mistakes and/or start with the previous value or whatever value the developer wants to supply.
 Itâ€™s licence is GPL v3 or above, enjoy.
 .
 To use in C/C++  the function is 
 ```C
 gzzreadline(char *prompt, char *prefill)
 ```
 .
 where 
  - **prompt** is the prompt.
  - **prefill** is the value to prefill the input buffer with. 
 .
  dont&apos;t forget to `free(value)` at the end as it was malloc&apos;d 
 .
 ```C
 #include &lt;gzz_readline.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 .
 int main(){
     char *value = gzzreadline(&quot;hello &gt; &quot;, &quot;fred&quot;); // this is the function //
     printf(&quot;value == %s\n&quot;, value);
     free(value);
 }
 ```
