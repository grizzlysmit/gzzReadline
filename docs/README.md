gzz_readline
============

This is a prompt package based on gnu readline.
The only difference is that it supports prefilling the edit buffer with text to edit, so it is easier to fix your mistakes and/or start with the previous value or whatever value the developer wants to supply.
It's licence is GPL v3 or above, enjoy.
