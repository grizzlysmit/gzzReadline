Desciption
==========

This is a prompt package based on gnu readline.
The only difference is that it supports prefilling the edit buffer with text to edit, so it is easier to fix your mistakes and/or start with the previous value or whatever value the developer wants to supply.
Itâ€™s licence is GPL v3 or above, enjoy.

To use in C/C++  the function is 
```C
gzzreadline(char *prompt, char *prefill)
```

where 
 - **prompt** is the prompt.
 - **prefill** is the value to prefill the input buffer with. 

 dont't forget to `free(value)` at the end as it was malloc'd 

```C
#include <gzz_readline.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    char *value = gzzreadline("hello > ", "fred"); // this is the function //
    printf("value == %s\n", value);
    free(value);
}
```
